Proverbs are traditional sayings that are particular to a certain country. They are short, wise sayings that usually offer some kind of advice, or capture an idea found in life.

Native English speakers frequently use proverbs in their conversations, and they often do this without even realizing it. Proverbs sometimes reveal more about the culture of a country than any textbook can. The values of the population are reflected in its proverbs.

Proverbs are also a critical part of engaging fluently with people of a particular culture. Ask any English tutor from the UK what some common English proverbs are, and they are sure to be different from those of an English tutor from the USA.
